## Mod that randomizes enemies (except drone and idol because they gave some problems)
This mod requires [UMM to work](https://github.com/Temperz87/ultra-mod-manager/tags).

You can configure the difficulty with BepInEx ConfigManager or from the file that is in BepInEx > config

## Configuration
> we will have more advanced configuration in the future.

To change configuration go to BepInEx/radsi.ultrarandomizer.cfg
