# UltraRandomizer
![example workflow](https://github.com/github/docs/actions/workflows/main.yml/badge.svg)
## Mod that randomizes enemies (except drone and idol because they gave some problems)
This mod requires [UMM to work](https://github.com/Temperz87/ultra-mod-manager/tags).

You can configure the difficulty with BepInEx ConfigManager or from the file that is in BepInEx > config

To install it put the mod in the "plugins" folder of BepInEx

To make a build you will need to add the game assembly and UMM as references in the project
